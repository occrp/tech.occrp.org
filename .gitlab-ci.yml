#
# how it works:
# 1. temporary directory /tmp/output/ is created/cleaned
# 2. stuff is generated into that clean directory
# 3. if the generation was successful, stuff is rsync into the actual output directory; stuff that has been removed in build is deleted in this process too

variables:
    # we do need that, look below
    PATH: '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/tmp/bin/'

before_script:
    - 'mkdir -p /tmp/output/' # create the temporary output dir if it does not exist
    - 'rm -rf /tmp/output/*'   # clear it if it does

# this builds the whole project,
# including the posts that have future dates and posts marked as published: false
