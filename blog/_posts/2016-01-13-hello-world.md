Around this time a year ago, OCCRP's Tech Team consisted of a single 
webmaster in Travnik and a few loyal friends who would be called upon to 
assist when new challenges arose. Since then, we've expanded to an 
excellent group of people, sitting mostly in Sarajevo and doing some pretty
amazing things. This new blog is to tell you of our adventures.

We are working with a lot of different technologies, managing some 
legacy systems, building new software and making sense of a lot of 
structure. The core aim of all of our activities is simple: shorten the 
time to journalism (TTJ).

In practice, this means a lot of stuff, from the simple-looking task of 
making sure it's possible to publish stories, with whatever visuals and 
interactives are needed, to serving tools for sharing and collaboration 
between journalists, to constructing gadgets that allow journalists to 
work more effectively, and designing and building new systems that allow 
journalists to work better with large volumes of data.

On this blog we'll try to go a bit deeper into the thoughts of what 
we're doing and why, explaining our thought processes and announcing 
exciting progressions. 

But first, some resources:

 * [OCCRP's website](https://occrp.org)
 * [OCCRP on Github](https://github.com/occrp)
 * [Investigative Dashboard](https://investigativedashboard.org)

That's all for now. Watch this space!
