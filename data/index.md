At OCCRP we acquire from many different sources and make it available in a consistent format to help jouralists with their investigations.

As well as access via the [Aleph API](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/wiki/API) we provide dumps of certain datasets for download as RDF.

Our internal data model is called Follow The Money and [documentation can be found here](https://alephdata.github.io/followthemoney/). The schema is also available as an RDF ontology: [w3id.org/ftm](https://w3id.org/ftm).

Public data we have released as RDF dumps are listed here:
