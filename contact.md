At the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)](https://occrp.org),
technology is used to enable investigative reporters from Central and Eastern
Europe, Africa and Latin America to hold power to account. We provide tools and
advice to find investigative leads in large amounts of data, enable and secure our mode
of networked collaboration and to tell stories on the web.

## Data Team

The data team handles the acquisition, processing, and analysis of relevant data for
OCCRP. It also operates the [Investigative Dashboard](https://investigativedashboard.org/).
