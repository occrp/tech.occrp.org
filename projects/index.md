The OCCRP believes that investigative reporting needs to be collaborative and open.
That's why, when if comes to the digital tools we rely on, we've made a large bet
on the development of free and open source software.

Some of our current projects include:

* **Investigative Dashboard**, a request tracking platform for research management.
  [Backend](https://github.com/occrp/id-backend) (Python, Django);
  [Frontend](https://github.com/occrp/id-frontend) (Ember.js); License: MIT.
* **aleph**, a structured data search tool for documents and databases.
  [Backend](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph) (Python, Flask);
  [Frontend](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph-ui) (React); 
  [Documentation](https://aleph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);

* **memorious**, a flexible and distributed scraping framework.
  [Written in Python](https://github.com/alephdata/memorious) using Celery, lxml,
  requests; [Documentation](https://memorious.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); License: MIT.
* **Related libraries**, for data normalisation and modelling:
  [fingerprints](https://github.com/alephdata/fingerprints) for entity key generation,
