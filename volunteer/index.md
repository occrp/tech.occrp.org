We want to understand how technology can help reporters to follow the money.
Data crawling, integration and analysis can lead us to investigative results
that no human can find. Digital security is needed for those who work in
countries where the rule of law has been attacked by organized crime.

That's why we're want to work with **data and security experts who want to
make a difference**.

### Challenges

Here's some concrete problems we need help with. If any of them sound
interesting to you, [send us a message](/contact/).

* Extracting **addresses from written text**. Addresses are extremely useful
  data points for investigations, but often they are mentioned in unstructured
  text documents. The ability to extract address candidates from such text
  would allow for easier cross-referencing of data. See also: 
  [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal).

* **Reverse-engineering the binary format of [Cronos](http://cronos.ru/)
  databases.** These are used for government databases in CIS countries, but
  there is no good tooling for programmatically extracting tables from them.
  We've got a [partial parser](https://github.com/occrp/cronosparser) for
  CronosPlus, but it fails to parse more recently-generated CronosPRO files.
  We also need an option for password recovery. Test data can be provided.

* Work with [YesWeHack](https://yeswehack.com/en/index.html) to penetration-test
  our services. We work with this french group to vet our web-facing services
  for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Sign up on their
  [BountyFactory](https://bountyfactory.io/) to learn about open challenges at
  OCCRP.
